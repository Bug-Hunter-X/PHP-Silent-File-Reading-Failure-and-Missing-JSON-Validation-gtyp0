This code suffers from a silent failure due to improper error handling. The `file_get_contents()` function can fail for various reasons (file not found, permission issues, network problems), and the code doesn't check the return value.  This means the script will continue running even if the file couldn't be read, leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect results. Additionally, there is no type checking to ensure that the returned JSON is what is expected.  This could lead to unexpected failures down the line.
