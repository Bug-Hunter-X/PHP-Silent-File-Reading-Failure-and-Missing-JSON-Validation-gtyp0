# PHP Silent File Reading Failure and Missing JSON Validation

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP involving `file_get_contents()` and a lack of JSON validation.  The original code lacks error handling, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The solution demonstrates proper error handling and JSON validation.

## Bug
The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code. It attempts to read a JSON file using `file_get_contents()` but fails to handle potential errors. If the file is not found, or if there is a problem reading it, the script continues without indicating any issues.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.php` file shows the corrected code, incorporating error checking and JSON validation for robust functionality.  It checks for errors from `file_get_contents()`, ensures the file is readable, and then parses the JSON, verifying its structure.
